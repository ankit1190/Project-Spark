        <p>Developed by RIOT Games</p>
        <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games for
            Microsoft Windows and macOS. The game follows a freemium model and is supported by microtransactions, and
            was inspired by the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod, Defense of the Ancients.</p>

                alt="Items.jpg" class="pics" id="items-pic" />Within the maps, summoners(players) choose champions to
            play and during the gameplay they use items to further modify their champions' stats.</p>

        <p>If you like what I talked about the game then please click the <strong>SIGN UP</strong> button in the navigation bar above. I will most probably not be able to play with you though since I am currently focusing on other things. But I would love to hear about how your experience in the game was, if you decided on playing the game. </p>
